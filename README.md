## üì• **Data Preparation**

Data is the foundation of any machine learning model. For **Suk AI**, we used the [COCO Dataset](https://cocodataset.org/) to train the object detection and image classification models.

### Key Steps:
- **Dataset**: We used the COCO dataset to cover diverse object categories.
- **Data Cleaning**: Cleaned the dataset to remove noise and ensure consistency.
- **Labeling**: Ensured proper bounding box annotations following the YOLO format.

> **Note**: You can also use your own datasets depending on your domain. Proper annotation and labeling are key to effective model training.

## üîß **Model Training**

We leveraged **YOLOv5** for object detection and **ResNet50** for image classification, all of which were trained using **NVIDIA AI Workbench** for GPU acceleration.

1. **Model Selection**: Started with **YOLOv5s** for its balance between speed and accuracy.
2. **Transfer Learning**: Fine-tuned the pre-trained YOLOv5 weights on our custom dataset.
3. **Training Parameters**:
   - **Epochs**: 25 for demonstration purposes, but more (100+) are recommended for real-world tasks.
   - **Batch Size**: 16 for training to balance speed and memory efficiency.

> **Tip**: Use pre-trained weights to save training time and improve accuracy. Transfer learning helps the model adapt quickly to new datasets.

## üé• **Real-Time Inference**

Once the model was trained, we deployed it for real-time inference using **OpenCV**. The model processes live video streams to detect and classify objects in real time.

- **Integration**: We integrated with **OpenCV** to process live video feeds, making it suitable for applications such as surveillance or automated product recognition.
- **Results**: Bounding boxes and class labels are displayed on the video stream for visual feedback.

## üèóÔ∏è **Challenges We Encountered**

Building **Suk AI** came with a number of challenges:
- **Data Quality**: Cleaning and preparing large datasets was time-consuming but crucial to ensure model performance.
- **Balancing Speed and Accuracy**: Fine-tuning the model to maintain low latency while ensuring high accuracy in real-time environments was a key challenge.
- **Real-Time Integration**: Ensuring that the object detection model could run efficiently on video streams without performance bottlenecks was vital for success.
